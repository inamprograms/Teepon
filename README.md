### Inspiration
You probably have tried to create plans with your friends and in the end have the plan fall through because everyone has such differing schedules and it just takes way too much effort right? I personally have tried to host a couple of get-together and catch-up session with friends too but we have such different lives that all our schedules cannot be any more different from each other's and I just give up because it is taking too much effort and time and replanning.

### The Solution
TPON is a platform that synchronizes all of your friends' calendars and helps you generate a detailed outing plan for you and your friends with just one tap of a button! Don't like the outing plan? Generate another one with another tap of a button!
\n
The outing plan generated ensures proximity and satisfaction to your friends' budgets and likes/dislikes too to ensure the most optimal and memorable outing for your and your friends.
